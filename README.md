# Slowly stamps tracker :mailbox_with_mail:

Do you like sending new stamps to your penpals when using
[Slowly](https://slowly.app/en/)?

Is it also difficult for you to keep track of which stamps you have already sent
to your pal when you have been having conversation for months? :dizzy_face:

Well, this small and simple **Flask** app is perfect to help you keep track of
which stamps you have sent to which of your pals.

## Running the App

* Prerequisites - install [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) in your system.
* One time run - `make setup` to setup the `venv`, and `make install` to install the requirements for the app.
* Once setup, simply run the app using - `make run`.
* Access frontend at : <http://localhost:5000>

## Resources

* Get all stamp images from
[here](https://slowly.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_stamps_on_Slowly)
* How to get user images? Simple! Open the slowly
[web_app](https://web.getslowly.com/), click on the user and right-click save
image!
* All your data is being stored locallly in the `resources` directory. Remember to
**keep it safe**!

## Alternative?

There's an alternate way to essentially carry out the same task. Ain't fully fleshed out yet
but [this](https://gist.github.com/dvaruas/2cf949033514af30f04da1b12003a059)
Github gist lays down the steps one can perform to not require any tracking.
(There is a caveat though so read it carefully!)
