# Slowly stamps tracker

Do you like sending new stamps to your penpals when using [Slowly](https://slowly.app/en/)?

Is it also difficult for you to keep track of which stamps you have already sent to your pal when you have been having conversation for months?

Well, this small and simple Flask app is perfect to help you keep track of which stamps you have sent to which of your pals.

Project requires python3

* `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* Run `python app.py`
* Access web app at `http://localhost:5000`

Or just use the docker image. It's much more simpler : `docker-compose up`. Access web-page similarly.

Get all stamp images from [here](https://slowly.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_stamps_on_Slowly)

How to get user images? Simple! Open the slowly web app, click on the user and right-click save image!

All your data is being stored locallly in the `resources` directory. Remember to keep it safe!

Have fun! :)
